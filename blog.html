<h1>Janice's Blog</h1>
<p>Blogging is just another way of writing a journal - albeit in the public eye.  This one will track my journey to create a
website for learning powershell and scripting when I don't really know much about web apps....</p>

<h2>September 16, 2017 - Headers * Footers</h2>
<p>Well, I'd like a common header and footer for all of the pages in my site.  So I started to update this blog and got completely
    sidetracked by my desire to add a horizontal line into the blog and get it to be the right colour and size.</p>

<p>So, now that this is done, my next goal is to figure out how to insert a common header and footer to the page.  I'd like the header to be
letterhead-like with my identification.  The footer needs to have a date and common link back to home.</p>

<p>My first take is to add a basic header and footer using HTML alone - <a href="html-css/htmlHeaders.html" >here</a>.  But I wanted to
have the date be dynamic - not part of a static web page, huh?  Well, javascript will have to wait for another day.</p>

<p>On my second take, I want to format the blog page using a CSS Flexbox</p>

<P>When that is done, I'm going to try it a third time using the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp">W3.CSS </a> framework</P>

<h2>September 9, 2017 - Blogging & Images</h2>
<p>
    Today I need to learn how to add images to my web pages.  In that process, I realized that I need a way to track what I did
    without creating formal <i>"how to"</i> pages.  Hence the Blog was conceived.</p>

<p>Some basics that I was oblivious to were things like the size of images.  I like photos, but have never really considered what
is done to prepare an image for the web.  So, at a minimal level, I needed to resize my image (a photo I took) for web resolution.
There are lots of ways to do it, Photoshop is the most common one, but I needed to do one or two images.  so, I searched the internet
    for a free tool that would do the job.  That's where I found <i><b>Web Resizer</b></i> - <a href="http://www.webresizer.com/resizer/" target="_blank">www.webresizer.com/resizer/</a></p>

<p>So I've now resized my image - it was 2800 kb and the new size is 37 kb.  The number of pixels has been significantly reduced.  Here is a screenshot of the websizer window.</p>

<p>Here is my image.  Let's try wrapping text around an image?</p>
