<h1>Janice McCullough</h1>
<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Looking for someone who can get things done? A problem solver where no challenge is too big? I enjoy smoothing out the wrinkles
    technology and people bring. I’m a Technology Professional who has done it all – software development, DevOps, installation and
    deployment, enterprise design and customer relations. This wealth of experience allows me to step in and contribute wherever needed.</p>

<p>As a Developer, I have worked extensively with distributed, multi-tiered systems crossing multiple languages and technologies. Agile, Unit Tests
    and TDD were standard. I applied my experience in operations to establish automated build, deployment and test processes –
    before DevOps was a term.</p>

<p>As an Analyst, I focused on building strong relationships with business, management, developers and support staff. I have extensive experience
    gathering business requirements, turning them into technical specifications and translating that into a vision for others to follow.</p>
<p>As an Integrator, I know how all of the pieces and parts work. Software, operating systems, hardware, networks – I know how they interconnect,
    what troubleshooting tools to use and when to dig for more information.</p>

<p>As a Technical Interpreter, I understand problems from every side – the Business Unit, Developers or IT staff. Establishing the requirements
    and concerns of each group, I then explain them to the other teams to obtain compromises to complex problems.</p>
    <p>• I like technology.</p>
    <p>•	I love solving problems</p>
    <p>•	My passion is getting business , people and technology working together</p>

<h3>Cheers!</h3>
