<h1>Powershell Scripting</h1>
<p>Took me a while to warm up to powershell, but it is an incredibly powerful method for automating just about anything you want to
in Windows or other Microsoft Products.
<br>
Let's dig right in. <br></p>

<h2>Getting Set Up</h2>
Critical to any scripting is to have the right IDE - Integrated Development Environment.  I have a lot of languages under my belt
and find that starting with a decent IDE can make it much faster to get started.

My preferred IDE is PowerGUI.  Originally developed by Quest software, Dell bought it several years ago and it stagnated.  Even so, the free version
is still out there.  You can find it here - http://www.softpedia.com/get/Programming/File-Editors/Quest-PowerGUI.shtml

<h3>Hello World</h3>
And, of course, the traditional Hello World.
